SpringBoardPatcher 1.0
by The Operator

Credit to dinopio and pumpkin for this.

This program is used to patch SpringBoard on 1.1.1 phones so that 3rd party applications will show up in SpringBoard.

You only need to use this program if you have previously activated/jailbroken a 1.1.1 phone using iNdependence version 1.2.2 and want to enable 3rd party applications in SpringBoard.  If you use iNdependence version 1.2.3 to activate/jailbreak a 1.1.1 phone, then it will do this for you automatically.

Note that your phone must be running firmware version 1.1.1 and be jailbroken for this to work.

Usage:

Simply double-click SpringBoardPatcher in Finder, or run it from the command-line using Terminal.  After it runs successfully, you must reboot your phone using the instructions given.

After your phone has rebooted, you should be able to install applications using iNdependence and have them show up in SpringBoard.
