v1.1 - 09/06/07

- Added Finder-like interface for adding ringtones, wallpapers, and applications.  Uses buttons or drag and drop.  Shows preview images for wallpaper files and application icons.

- Added "Remove SSH" button for same reason
- Jailbreak has been verified to work on Windows via a command-line application.  In the process of adding some missing CF functionality so that activation will work too.  It's getting closer... :)
