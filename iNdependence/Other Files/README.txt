** INSTALLING INDEPENDENCE **

Before you can run iNdependence for the first time, you must do the following:

1) Copy iNdependence to your hard drive somewhere (the Applications folder would be a good place)
2) Run the "iNdependence MobDev Tool" application.  If it reports that you have the correct version of iTunes installed, then you simply need to choose the location where you installed iNdependence on your computer and you are done (skip the remaining steps).
3) If it reports that you do not have the correct version of iTunes installed, then you'll need to find the version of the MobileDevice framework that was installed with iTunes 7.4.2 and put it somewhere on your computer.  Something useful might be at:

http://rapidshare.com/files/68410680/MobileDevice_7_4_2.framework.zip.html

4) Once you have that, choose the location of the MobileDevice.framework folder using the first file chooser.
5) If that works, then choose the location where you installed iNdependence on your computer using the second file chooser.
6) At this point you should see a success message.

If you do not successfully do this, then iNdependence will not run (it will show up in the dock quickly and then disappear).  After you are done, then iNdependence will run without problems no matter what version of iTunes you upgrade to.  You only need to do this once.

*** The remaining documentation for using iNdependence can be found in the Help menu within the application itself ***
