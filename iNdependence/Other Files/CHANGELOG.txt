Changelog
---------

v1.0 - 08/23/07

- Initial release for Mac (universal binary)


v1.1 - 09/06/07

- Added ability to add/remove applications to/from the phone.  This includes setting the correct permissions and restarting Springboard
- Added Finder-like interface for adding ringtones, wallpapers, and applications.  Uses buttons or drag and drop.  Shows preview images for wallpaper files and application icons.
- Added "Restore PEM File" button which allows users to restore the original PEM file back onto their phone (useful when trying to undo all modifications for a firmware update)
- Added "Remove SSH" button for same reason
- Jailbreak has been verified to work on Windows via a command-line application.  In the process of adding some missing CF functionality so that activation will work too.  It's getting closer... :)


v1.1.1 - 09/06/07

- Fixes problems with jailbreak when iTunes 7.4 is installed


v1.2 (Éphémère) - 09/11/07

- Added better iTunes version checking so that iNdependence will fail if an unsupported version of iTunes is installed (thus avoiding the nasty problems seen with the iTunes 7.4 update)
- Put in new fast jailbreak method (thanks to anonymous)
- Made Activation/Deactivation all-in-one steps (no more fiddling with activation files)
- Removed PEM and activation file related buttons/menus
- Created a Windows command-line version of iNdependence (has everything except SSH and Customization)
- Made it so that if iNdependence detects a phone in restore mode, it will attempt to unbrick it


v1.2.1 (Aventinus) - 09/13/07

- Added YouTube fix to activation process
- Fixed bug where Activation/Deactivation buttons are enabled when no phone is connected
- Put detected iTunes version number in unsupported version error message
- Made it so that iNdependence will terminate if it can't initialize properly (eg. bad iTunes version)
- Fixed iTunes version detection on international (ie. non North American localized) computers
- Added handling for case where SSH is connecting to the phone for the first time (doesn't know about IP address)
- Also added handling for case where SSH fails because there is an invalid entry in ~/.ssh/known_hosts.  iNdependence will offer to remove the invalid entry.
- Added wait dialog when removing applications (restarting Springboard)
- Fixed bug where, after removing SSH, the install/remove SSH buttons weren't being updated properly

- Added firmware tab which contains functions related to upgrading and downgrading the phone's firmware (mainly between 1.0.2 and 1.1.1)

- Fixed bug with SFTP failing on pre-1.1.1 upgrade step under some circumstances
- Numerous documentation bugfixes
- Added SpringBoard patch to enable 3rd party applications
- Integrated the post-1.1.1 upgrade step into jailbreak to make things easier
