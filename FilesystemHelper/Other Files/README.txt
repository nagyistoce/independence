Toolchain Helper v1.0.2
written by The Operator

Toolchain Helper is a program to copy the filesystem from your iPhone onto your computer.  This makes it so that you don't have to use the firmware restore DMG from Apple when working with the toolchain (which requires you to break the DMG encryption -- illegal in the US).

The UI is pretty self-explanitory, but in case you need more explanation...

"Copy Core Filesystem" copies the main filesystem from the iPhone to your computer (without copying all the MP3s, pictures, and settings).  This is much faster if you have a lot of media files on your phone.

"Copy Full Filesystem" copies everything from the phone to your computer.

Note that nothing works unless the phone is in jailbreak mode.

Also note that if it fails, try quitting and restarting the app.

Have fun...
