				<p>
				iNdependence works well with firmware 1.1.3 and 1.1.4.  You don't need to do any special steps when upgrading.  Just upgrade as usual using iTunes and then activate/jailbreak/SIM unlock easily using iNdependence.
			        <p>One thing to note with the 1.1.3/1.1.4 firmware is that the very first time you jailbreak/activate/SIM unlock your phone, iNdependence will give a message saying that it's generating a RAM disk file.  This is normal.  It takes a bit of extra time, but it will only be done once.
			</div>
			<div summary="How to activate your phone" id="activation">
				<h1>To activate your phone:</h1>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Select the Activation tab and press the <i>Activate Phone</i> button.  On occasion, iNdependence will give an error message saying that it failed to enter recovery mode.  If this happens, just quit and restart iNdependence and try it again.  Also, if you are waiting a long time and nothing changes on the phone screen, force quit and restart iNdependence and try again.</li>
						<li>You should see a message saying <i>Waiting for jail break...</i>.  Please be patient as it will take a while to do this.  At one point you'll see a bunch of text scrolling down the screen.  This is normal.</li>
						<li>Wait for the success message.  Note that the activation process will also enable YouTube for you.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div summary="How to jailbreak your phone" id="jailbreak">
				<h1>To jailbreak your phone:</h1>
				<p>
					Note that this will be done automatically if you activate your phone.
					<ol>
						<li>Select the <i>Jailbreak</i> tab and press the <i>Perform Jailbreak</i> button.  On occasion, iNdependence will give an error message saying that it failed to enter recovery mode.  If this happens, just quit and restart iNdependence and try it again.  Also, if you are waiting a long time and nothing changes on the phone screen, force quit and restart iNdependence and try again.</li>
						<li>You should see a message saying <i>Waiting for jail break...</i>.  Please be patient as it will take a while to do this.  At one point you'll see a bunch of text scrolling down the screen.  This is normal.</li>
						<li>Wait for the success message.</li>

			<div summary="Installing and configuring SSH" id="ssh">
				<h1>Installing and Configuring SSH</h1>
				<p>
					Installing SSH is a breeze once your phone is jailbroken.  Just choose the <i>SSH</i> tab and press the <i>Install SSH/SCP/SFTP</i> button.  Then follow the instructions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The default accounts on the phone are:<br><br>

					username: root<br>
					password: dottie<br><br>

					username: mobile<br>
					password: alpine
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember to change the default passwords after installing SSH using the <i>Change Password</i> button.  I'm not responsible if someone hacks your phone.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want to later remove SSH, you can do so using the <i>Remove SSH</i> button.  iNdependence will ask you if you want to also remove certain files which might be shared with other applications on your phone at that time.  Please read the description of those files carefully before you choose to remove them.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div summary="SIM Unlocking" id="simunlock">
			    <h1>SIM Unlocking</h1>
				<p>
				    SIM unlocking allows you to use your phone with any digital cellular service provider (as opposed to being tied to one provider and a long contract).</b>
				</p>
				<p>
				    To perform a SIM unlock, simply select the <i>Activation / SIM</i> tab and press the <i>SIM Unlock Phone</i> button.  It'll take a couple of minutes, so please be patient.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div summary="Installing ringtones, wallpapers, and applications" id="customization">
				<h1>Customization</h1>
				<p>
					The <i>Customize</i> tab uses a Finder-style interface and allows for drag and drop installation of ringtones, wallpapers, and applications.  You can also use the <i>Add</i> and <i>Delete</i> buttons.
				</p>
				<h2>Third Party Applications</h2>
				<p>
					Please note that in order to install/remove applications, you'll need to have SSH installed on the phone as you'll be asked for the phone's IP address and root password.
				</p>
				<p>
					To find the phone's IP address, launch the Settings application, navigate to <i>Wi-Fi</i> and press the blue arrow beside the name of the Wi-Fi network that your phone is connected to.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Once SSH is installed, you can install third party applications by either dragging and dropping the applications from Finder into the System/User folder, or you can press the <i>Add</i> button to select the application from a file chooser.  To remove an application, simply select it and press the <i>Delete</i> button.
				</p>
				<h2>Ringtones</h2>
				<p>
				    Ringtone installation is done through iTunes (it's disabled in iNdependence when using firmware 1.1.3/1.1.4).
				</p>
				<h2>Wallpapers</h2>
				<p>
					Wallpapers must be 2 PNG (<b>.png</b>) files (the main image and the thumbnail image).  The wallpaper image sizes I use are 320x480 for the main image and 75x75 for the thumbnail image.  These seem to work well for me.
				</p>
				<p>
					One caveat when using iNdependence with firmware 1.1.3/1.1.4 is that you can only install custom wallpapers into the <i>System</i> folder (not the <i>User</i> folder).  The <i>Add</i> and <i>Delete</i> buttons will stay disabled when the <i>User</i> wallpaper folder is selected.
