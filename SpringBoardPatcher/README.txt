SpringBoardPatcher v2
by The Operator

Credit to dinopio and pumpkin for this.

This program is used to patch SpringBoard on 1.1.1 phones so that 3rd party applications will show up in SpringBoard.  It can also be used to undo the SpringBoard patching done by iNdependence.

Note that patching SpringBoard to allow for 3rd party applications is done automatically by newer versions of iNdependence (version 1.2.3 and higher).

Note that your phone must be running firmware version 1.1.1 and be jailbroken for this to work.


Usage:

To enable 3rd party application support:

Simply double-click SpringBoardPatcher in Finder, or run it from the command-line using Terminal.  After it runs successfully, you must reboot your phone using the instructions given.

After your phone has rebooted, you should be able to install applications using iNdependence and have them show up in SpringBoard.


To disable 3rd party application support (returns SpringBoard to it's original state):

Run SpringBoardPatcher from Terminal using the -undo option (eg. ./SpringBoardPatcher -undo).    After it runs successfully, you must reboot your phone using the instructions given.
