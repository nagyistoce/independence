300MBKiller 1.0
by The Operator

This program is used to fix the problem where iTunes only sees 300 MB of disk space which people are having after they use iNdependence 1.2.2 to jailbreak a phone with firmware 1.1.1.

You only need to use this program if you have previously activated/jailbroken a 1.1.1 phone using iNdependence version 1.2.2 and are seeing only 300 MB of disk space available in iTunes.

Note that your phone must be running firmware version 1.1.1 and be jailbroken for this to work.

Usage:

Simply double-click 300MBKiller in Finder, or run it from the command-line using Terminal.  Then follow the instructions.
