Draft of new ramdisk system:

CURRENTLY UNTESTED

"sudo make ramdisk" will make the ramdisk (ramdisk.dmg) under Linux system. For BSD-like systems such as OS X,
a 512 KB filesystem HFSX case-sensitive filesystem should be created. It should have two directories: /mnt
and /sbin. launchd should be copied to /sbin. It should be chown'ed to 0:0 and have 755 permissions.

ramdisk.dmg ought to be padded before used (but it should be distributed without the padding to save space).

Before the ramdisk is used, there ought to be a folder called /private/var/mobile/Media/jailbreak/. It should
contain the "jailbreak" executable also made here. jailbreak checks for the existence of files in 
/private/var/mobile/Media/jailbreak/ to decide what to do. If it sees "activate" it will attempt to activate.
If it sees "simunlock" it will attempt to unlock. The contents of those files are irrelevant, just the names.

If activation is desired, /private/var/mobile/Media/jailbreak/optivate must exist, as well as data_ark.plist,
device_private_key.pem, and device_public_key.pem in the same folder.

If unlock is desired, /private/var/mobile/Media/jailbreak/gunlock_0p, /private/var/mobile/Media/jailbreak/secpack
and /private/var/mobile/Media/jailbreak/ICE04.02.13_G.fls must also exist.

The behavior of jailbreak is based on iNdependence's ramdisk /etc/profile.

FILES
