			<div summary="How to upgrade to 1.1.1 or 1.1.2 so that you can jailbreak and activate" id="upgrade">
				<h1>To upgrade to 1.1.1 or 1.1.2 so that you can activate/jailbreak your phone:</h1>
				<p><b>Please note that if you have used anySIM 1.0 or other older free SIM unlocking solutions (anything except anySIM 1.1/1.2, gunlock, and iPhoneSimFree) to SIM unlock your phone, and you upgrade to 1.1.x, it will wipe out the SIM unlock and render the phone and text message part of your phone inoperable.  Everything else will work though.</b>
			        <p>(<b>Update</b>)You only need to do this if you are upgrading to firmware 1.1.1 or 1.1.2.  If you are upgrading to 1.1.3 or 1.1.4, then you can skip all of this directly upgrade via iTunes.
			        <p>
					<ol>
						<li>Check the firmware version that's reported in the status line at the bottom of the iNdependence window and ensure that you are using firmware 1.0.2 (or lower).</li>
						<li>Activate your phone using the <a href="#activation">activation instructions above</a>.  Note that you should leave your phone jailbroken after activation.</li>
						<li>Install SSH on your phone using <a href="#ssh">the instructions below</a>.</li>
						<li>Ensure that your phone is connected to a Wi-Fi network (read the iPhone manual for instructions on how to set up Wi-Fi).  Also ensure that it's IP address does not conflict with any other devices on your Wi-Fi network (sorry, I can't offer network admin help).</li>
						<li>Get the IP address for your phone by launching the Settings application on the phone, navigating to <i>Wi-Fi</i> and pressing the blue arrow beside the name of the Wi-Fi network that your phone is connected to.</li>
						<li>Select the <i>Firmware</i> tab and press the <i>Pre Firmware Upgrade</i> button.</li>
						<li>Enter the IP address of the phone and the root password (see <a href="#ssh">below</a> for the default root password if you didn't change it when you installed SSH).</li>
						<li>Follow the instructions given in the dialog windows.  If iNdependence gives you a warning about <i>host verification failure</i> and asks to edit your <b>known_hosts</b> file, choose the <i>Yes</i> option (which is now the default).</li>
						<li>Once you are told to upgrade using iTunes, quit iNdependence, and hold down the option key while pressing the <i>Update</i> button in the iTunes window (not the </i>Restore</i> button).  Then select the 1.1.1 or 1.1.2 firmware file when prompted.</li>
						<li>Wait for iTunes to finish.</li>
						<li>Quit iTunes and relaunch iNdependence.  In the status bar at the bottom of the iNdependence window you should see <i>Firmware 1.1.1</i> or <i>Firmware 1.1.2</i> (depending on which one you upgraded to).</li>
						<li>Congratulations!  You are now ready to activate/jailbreak your phone using the <a href="usage_1_1_1.html#activation">1.1.x instructions</a>.</li>
					</ol>

			<div summary="Installing and configuring SSH" id="ssh">
				<h1>Installing and Configuring SSH</h1>
				<p>
					Installing SSH is a breeze once your phone is jailbroken.  Just choose the <i>SSH</i> tab and press the <i>Install SSH/SCP/SFTP</i> button.  Then follow the instructions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The default accounts on the phone are:<br><br>

					username: root<br>
					password: dottie<br><br>

					username: mobile<br>
					password: alpine
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember to change the default passwords after installing SSH using the <i>Change Password</i> button.  I'm not responsible if someone hacks your phone.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want to later remove SSH, you can do so using the <i>Remove SSH</i> button.  iNdependence will ask you if you want to also remove certain files which might be shared with other applications on your phone at that time.  Please read the description of those files carefully before you choose to remove them.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div summary="SIM Unlocking" id="simunlock">
			    <h1>SIM Unlocking</h1>
				<p>
				    SIM unlocking allows you to use your phone with any digital cellular service provider (as opposed to being tied to one provider and a long contract).</b>
				</p>
				<p>
				    To perform a SIM unlock, simply select the <i>Activation / SIM</i> tab and press the <i>SIM Unlock Phone</i> button.  It'll take a couple of minutes, so please be patient.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div summary="Installing ringtones, wallpapers, and applications" id="customization">
				<h1>Customization</h1>
				<p>
					The <i>Customize</i> tab uses a Finder-style interface and allows for drag and drop installation of ringtones, wallpapers, and applications.  You can also use the <i>Add</i> and <i>Delete</i> buttons.
				</p>
				<h2>Third Party Applications</h2>
				<p>
					Please note that in order to install/remove applications, you'll need to have SSH installed on the phone as you'll be asked for the phone's IP address and root password.
				</p>
				<p>
					To find the phone's IP address, launch the Settings application, navigate to <i>Wi-Fi</i> and press the blue arrow beside the name of the Wi-Fi network that your phone is connected to.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Once SSH is installed, you can install third party applications by either dragging and dropping the applications from Finder into the System/User folder, or you can press the <i>Add</i> button to select the application from a file chooser.  To remove an application, simply select it and press the <i>Delete</i> button.
				</p>
				<h2>Ringtones</h2>
				<p>
					Ringtones must be MPEG-4 audio (<b>.m4a</b>) files as the file chooser will only allow you to choose <b>.m4a</b> files.
				</p>
				<h2>Wallpapers</h2>
				<p>
					Wallpapers must be 2 PNG (<b>.png</b>) files (the main image and the thumbnail image).  The wallpaper image sizes I use are 320x480 for the main image and 75x75 for the thumbnail image.  These seem to work well for me.
