How To Build
------------

** Mac **

Requirements: XCode tools version 2.4.1 or higher


1) Copy /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MobileDevice.framework to /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.VERSION.sdk/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ (where VERSION is the SDK version XCode uses to compile against)
2) Open iNdependence/iNdependence.xcodeproj in XCode and build it.
3) Built app will be in iNdependence/build/<build_type>/


** Windows **

Requirements: Dev-C++, OpenSSL 0.9.8e, QuickTime SDK

1) Open iNdependence/iNdependence.dev in Dev-C++ and edit the include and library paths to match your build setup.
2) Build it.  This will produce iNdependence.exe in the iNdependence/Win32 directory.
3) Open your favorite shell, navigate to the iNdependence/Win32 directory, and type:

If using MSYS: ./iNdependence.sh
If using DOS prompt: ./iNdependence.bat

You should see a list of commands you can perform.
